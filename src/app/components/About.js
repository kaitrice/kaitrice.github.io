        <h3>A little about me</h3>
        <p>I'm driven by a love for combining the logical side of coding with creative UX design, making every project an exciting challenge. I enjoy JavaScript, React, Node.js, and building responsive, engaging cross-platform apps. I have desire to always learn and grow, doing my best to constantly evolve as a person and developer!</p>
        <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy hanging out with my two <span id='cats'>orange cats</span>, playing video games, enjoying live music, and drinking <span id='redbull'>Red BullÂ®</span>.</p>
